i'm still waiting for the list of differences between lisp and php that matter.
sometimes i think lisp is as deadly to programmer competence as java or basic.
all scripting languages are the same.
just because it's inflammatory doesn't mean it's wrong
in my very firm opinion, it's never your business to be figuring out pointer type at runtime.
lisp is yet another half-assed run-of-the-mill scripting language. absolutely *no different* from something like php in any significant way worth mentioning.
common lisp reminds me of fortran and cobol, all three are about as much fun to program in.
c++ is the way it is for a very, very good reason.
the problem is that ocaml has mandatory garbage collection.
every half-assed dynamically-typed, ass-slow scripting language is Lisp but a bit different
if programming languages were gods, something like smalltalk would be Cloacina, the goddess of the sewers
dynamic typing is *always* a compiler bug.
the only reason for 'dispatching, polymorphism and parametrization' to exist at all is for enforcing safety.
i know and program in more languages than can fit in your short-term memory, ok?
good developers will write good code in absolutely any language, while bad developers will develop crap no matter the tools they use.
you might pass for somebody intelligent when you keep your mouth shut.
a language with type inference isn't more expressive -- because type declarations are redundant, much like 'sigils' in perl.
the lisp folks have purposefully made lisp so that static analysis is impossible.
'static' and 'dynamic' are disjoint sets. no matter if you're talking about typing or anything else.
good lord, help me. i feel like i'm trapped in a website full of elizabots.
are you really this dense, or just trolling me?
you cannot write a lisp compiler that is as good as a C compiler
go read a book or something
you forgot the fact that ocaml is used for writing real software that solves real problems, unlike haskell.
i can program in assembly as well as i can program in c++
the statement that c++ is 'simpler' than assembly is so patently stupid i have doubts that you can program at all.
i don't know about you, but i only use c++ because it gives static compile-time guarantees that assembly could never give.
laziness is TEH SUCK, by the way. there's a reason we got rid of it after writing the first fortran compiler.
so, to summarize: laziness per your definition is a form of syntactic sugar that saves one or two lines of code while making programs slower.  whoop de doo
never heard of malbolge before, but i'd think that writing a simple source-to-source translator from some sort of minimal vm assembly to malbolge shouldn't be too difficult.
check out 'complexity theory', it's all there.
oh come on, what do 'functional languages' have to do with lambda calculus?
lisp is a wannabe python from the seventies.
i can write clean and 'expressive' code (quickly) in any language and paradigm, thank you very much.
what you linked to is neither formal nor a notion.
all you happened to have demonstrated is that you suck at writing assembly code.
it's 2006 already, and the world doesn't need 'dynamic languages'. otherwise, we'd be all programming in perl.
