# Lambdabot: A friendly IRC bot and apprentice coder, written in Haskell.

![Haskell-CI](https://github.com/lambdabot/lambdabot/workflows/Haskell-CI/badge.svg)

Lambdabot is an IRC bot written over several years by those on the #haskell
IRC channel.

It operates as a command line tool, embedded in an editor, embedded in GHCi,
via internet relay chat and on the web.
