> 17:11 < dmhouse> Notice how I'm speaking again, and hsbot isn't buzzing me more than that one time.
> 17:12 < dmhouse> It'll buzz me after a day's worth of not checking my messages.
> 17:12 < dmhouse> If I want to check them in the intermittent period, I can either send a /msg, or:

> 17:12 < hsbot> You have 2 messages
> 17:12 < dmhouse> Let's check them, shall we?

> [Back in the channel
> 17:12 < dmhouse> You needn't use a /msg, however. If you're not going to annoy the channel by printing 20 of
>                  your messages, feel free to just type '@messages' in the channel.
> 17:12 < davidhouse> @tell dmhouse foobar
> 17:12 < hsbot> Consider it noted
> 17:12 < davidhouse> @ask dmhouse barfoo
> 17:12 < hsbot> Consider it noted
> 17:12 < davidhouse> You can see there @ask. It's just a synonym for @tell, but it prints "foo asked X ago M",
>                     which is more natural. E.g. '@ask dons whether he's applied my latest patch yet?'
> 17:13 < dmhouse> For the admins, a useful little debugging tool is @print-notices.
> 17:13 < hsbot> dmhouse: You have 2 new messages. '/msg hsbot @messages' to read them.
> 17:14 < dmhouse> Notice that hsbot pinged me there, even though it's less than a day since I last checked my
>                  messages, because there have been some new ones posted.
> 17:14 < dmhouse> @print-notices
> 17:14 < hsbot> {"dmhouse":=(Just Thu Jun  8 17:13:46 BST 2006,[Note {noteSender = "davidhouse", noteContents =
