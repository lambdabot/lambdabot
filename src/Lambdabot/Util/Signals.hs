-- | The signal story.
-- Posix signals are external events that invoke signal handlers in
-- Haskell. The signal handlers in turn throw dynamic exceptions.  Our
-- instance of MonadError for LB maps the dynamic exceptions to
-- SignalCaughts, which can then be caught by a normal catchIrc or
-- handleIrc

-- Here's where we do that.
